## Intro
A **work-in-progress** open source project to simulate the [ZX Spectrum's screen drawing capabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum_graphic_modes), in the style of a simple modern-ish image manipulation editor! Includes realistic pixel dimensions, and proper attribute-based colour schemes. Why? Simply because the [Sinclair ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) is a unique monster from the 80s that has had such a massive impact on gaming, and demo scenes with its unique screen drawing capabilities. Even more honestly - we just wanted to become familiar with `SDL2` to enhance our skillset for future cross-platform medical simulation software, and just happen to be huge Speccy fans! üòä
